Module 4 Assignment

Summary of Analysis: 
Notebook that analyzies data specific to high schools, grades 9-12. Different analysis took place to review the impact that budget, type of school, size of school, number of students had on math and reading scores. 

Written Analysis (Conclusions from data): Through the analysis, you can see that Charter schools score higher than district schools. This could be due to a number of factors,one of which is charter schools, on average, have less students than the district schools.  However, one item I found interesting is that the greater the budget per student, the lower the averages in test scores. I did not expect that. Also, the smaller the school size, the higher their average test scores.
This was a fun exercise to work on!
